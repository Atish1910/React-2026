🧩 Problem Statement
Build a mini e-commerce UI using React with the following requirements:
✅ Requirements
1️⃣ Product Listing
Fetch products from an API
Display product name and price
2️⃣ Search Functionality
Search products by name
Add pagination (10 items per page)
Pagination should reset when search input changes
3️⃣ Currency Toggle
Toggle between USD ↔ INR
Conversion rate: 1 USD = 85 INR ( consider taking live conversion rate if possible )
❗ Do NOT mutate product data
4️⃣ Add to Cart
Add products to cart
If product already exists, increase quantity
Cart should show item count and total price
5️⃣ Clear Cart
Clear all cart items using correct React data flow
Cart state should be owned by the parent component
6️⃣ Performance Constraint
Avoid unnecessary re-renders
Do NOT blindly use useMemo
7️⃣ Bonus (Advanced)
Lazy load the Cart using code splitting
Cart should load only when user interacts with it
